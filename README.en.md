 A program for creating ToDo tasks.
 202312-todo is a feature-rich task management application developed in Python. 
 
It offers two user-friendly interfaces: a command-line console application and a REST API for integration with web applications and other systems.

With todoapp, users can easily add, view, update, and delete tasks while saving all changes to a shared database. It is a flexible solution for effective time and task management

#### CLI part of the application:
 The console application provides a text-based interface to work through the command line, allowing users to quickly add, edit, and view tasks. The start is carried out using additional parameters, such as:
   - **<i>python -m src.cli --task_list</i>** - will output all tasks from the database

#### API part of the application:
 Web interface: Provides a REST API through which you can interact with the application using HTTP requests. This allows you to integrate the app with other systems and create a user interface on the website or mobile app.
